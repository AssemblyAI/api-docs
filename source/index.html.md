# AssemblyAI

Integrate the AssemblyAI API to recognize speech in your application in real-time or asynchronously. Create custom models to more accurately recognize speech, and expand vocabulary with custom words like product/person names.

# Custom Models

Upload your historical transcripts (just the text) to AssemblyAI to create a custom model that will be up to 50% more accurate than generic speech APIs.

Create as many custom models as you want: one per customer, one per dialogue state in an IVR system, or one per user.

### How it Works

AssemblyAI learns from the text in your historical transcripts to create a custom model

### Example

Lets say you are transcribing phone calls for 10 different customers. Using the historical transcripts of the phone calls for each customer, you would create a custom model for each customer. Then, when you send audio to the API for transcribing, you can tell the API which custom model to use to transcribe the speech.

### Bootstrapping custom models

Don’t have historical transcripts? You can also upload example transcripts to AssemblyAI to bootstrap a custom model.

See examples in the Guides section.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```

This endpoint retrieves all kittens.
